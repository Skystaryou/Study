Description: # Solving EIT via PDE constrained optimization
        
        This is a python implementation of a optimization-based estimation of the EIT problem, using PDE constrained optimization, without regularization. 
        
        ## Requirements: 
        
        -numpy
        
        -scipy 
        
        (to add more here)
        
        For some of the examples we will use the h5py library to extract the data (already contained in the tests folder)
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install just go to the main directory and install as usual: 
        
        python setup.py install
        
        This will install the package on your local python environment (we strongly recommend to create a virtual environment before hand)
        
        ## Tests
        
        We have added a context.py script in the test folder, this would allow to run the test files without having to install the package on your local environment.
